## Introduction to Stirling PDF

Stirling PDF is a robust, locally hosted, web-based platform for PDF manipulation, powered by Docker. It offers a comprehensive range of features, from basic functions like merging and splitting PDFs to advanced capabilities such as compression, OCR, and conversions.

Although the application is open-source, the majority of development is done by a single developer in their spare time. If you appreciate this work, please consider donating to support its continued development!

## Benefits

### Privacy comes first

Originally conceived as a ChatGPT-powered tool, Stirling PDF has evolved to meet a wide range of PDF-related needs. Crucially, the platform prioritizes privacy and security: it does not make outbound calls for tracking or record-keeping. All files and PDFs are handled on the client side or are temporarily stored on the server only during task execution. Once a file is downloaded, it is immediately removed from the server.

### Always improving

Stirling PDF benefits from an active community that contributes ideas and helps with its open-source development. New features are regularly added, ensuring that Stirling PDF continually evolves.

### Options

Stirling-PDF is yours. You can modify and adapt it to fit your needs or those of your business. We offer various customization options and welcome feature requests and bug reports through our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cn8pWhQRxZ).
